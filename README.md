# entity_linking_topic_model

We designed and implemented an entity-linking system to link short and poorly composed search queries to corre- sponding Wikipedia pages. The system strives for enriching query contents as document for each query and utillizing web search results (contents of Wikipedia Pages) as can- didate documents for all possible entities. After text pre- process, unsupervised LDA topic model is used to extract useful information through Gibbs sampling iterations. Af- ter the last iteration, all topics are represented as global word map probability distribution, all documents as topic statis- tic distribution. Then we sort the cos-similarity values be- tween query document and entity documents of each query. Finally we apply rules for query-entity matching.
